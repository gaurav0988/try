					<p>Restorative dentistry is the study, diagnosis and integrated management of diseases of the teeth and their supporting structures and the rehabilitation of the dentition to functional and aesthetic requirements of the individual. Restorative dentistry encompasses the dental specialties of endodontics, periodontics and prosthodontics and its foundation is based upon how these interact in cases requiring multifaceted care. This may require the close input from other dental specialties such as orthodontics, paediatric dentistry and special care dentistry, as well as surgical specialties such as oral and maxillofacial surgery.Restorative dentistry aims to treat the teeth and their supporting structures. Many conditions and their consequences may be assessed and treated by a restorative dentist. Environmental causes may include as caries or maxillofacial trauma.</p>

        <div class="editContent">
        <p>Restorative dental procedures have many benefits, which is why they are some of the most commonly performed procedures by dentists.Restore function. The biggest benefit of restorative procedures is that the functionality of your teeth is restored. You can eat and talk with relative ease because your teeth are healthy.Eliminate pain. If you have a deep cavity or an infected tooth that needs a root canal, you have probably experienced severe pain related to these issues. Restorative procedures eliminate that pain by correcting the problem or removing the infection.Improve appearance. Restorative procedures can make your teeth look better so that you can smile with confidence.Prevent further dental issues. Correcting a dental issue as soon as it is detected can prevent it from getting worse or causing more dental issues. Having a cavity filled as soon as your dentist notices it can prevent it from leading to a root canal. A cavity that is ignored for too long can result in a tooth that canâ€™t be saved that will need to be extracted and replaced.
